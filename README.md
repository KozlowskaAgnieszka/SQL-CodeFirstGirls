### Welcome, folks, to the grand finale of the Data & SQL course by [**Code First Girls**](https://codefirstgirls.com/courses/coding-kickstarter/): The MySQL Project - Console Game Store!

Here are the exciting topics I've delved into during this course:

We started off by getting hands-on with the SQL programming language and data.
We then mastered the art of SQL coding and database management techniques.
We explored how to analyze complex structures and data.
We learned the ins and outs of data manipulation using SQL programming language.
Finally, we wrapped up by mastering data management with SQL coding techniques.

And drumroll please... presenting my #### [certificate of completion with distinction](https://github.com/KozlowskaAgnieszka/SQL-CodeFirstGirls/blob/main/CFG%20Data%20%26%20SQL%20-%20Certificate.pdf)! You can also check out my #### [Project Presentation](https://github.com/KozlowskaAgnieszka/SQL-CodeFirstGirls/blob/main/CONSOLE%20GAME%20STORE%20presentation.pdf) to see all the cool things I've accomplished.
